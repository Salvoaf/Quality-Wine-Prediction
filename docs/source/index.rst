Welcome to Wine Project's documentation!
========================================
For this project, we participate in a competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009.

This competition aims at a classification task: try to understand whether a wine is good or not from chemical wine characteristics.

For the aim, three modules are built: “main,” which contains the start of the project; “preprocessing,” in which the dataset is prepared for the classification part; ”analysis,” which includes algorithms used for prediction.
Every subsection is explained in them.
